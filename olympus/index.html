                    <h1>Olympus Medical</h1>
                    <p>In an effort to increase potential patient screenings, the website ColonoscopyToday.com was launched as a part of a direct to patient marketing campaign. This direct to patient marking approach focused on driving consumers to learn more about the importance of colorectal cancer screenings. This responsive website served as a digital solution to reach the target age group for screenings which is 50 years and older. ColonoscopyToday.com encouraged patients to take action through positive messaging, while helping patients to find a partnering physician and schedule a screening.</p>

                        <h4>Problem</h4>
                        <p>Olympus Medical, a precision technology leader, creates innovative solutions in healthcare and worked with 90% of gastroenterologists in the colorectal screening market. At the time, only 60% of the target age group got screened, leaving 40% of the market to target with further outreach campaigns. The client requested we create a digital presence to help promote the life-saving necessity of getting screened, while also dispelling misconceptions about the preparation and screening process.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="solution">
                        <h4>Solution</h4>
                        <p>Our team was appointed to develop a website that would focus on growing the Olympus Medical brand while promoting colorectal cancer awareness. Our goal was to meet this target, paying attention to the client’s requirements, utilizing efficient development tools, and incorporating unique design solutions. To further enrich user engagement, we crafted various interactive features such as a physician finder and a risk assessment quiz.</p>

                    <h4>Audience Influences Aesthetic</h4>
                    <p>With the target audience being 50 or older, our team aimed to strike a delicate balance between simplicity and visual interest, ensuring that the typography and imagery captivated users without overwhelming them. To achieve this, we carefully integrated subtle animations into specific elements, aligning with the established branding while avoiding excessive complexity.</p>
                    <p>The central aspect of the website’s design is that all elements are structured in an editorial-style layout, ranging from images to block-based tiles. In our design approach, we aimed to showcase “Life’s Greatest Moments” through relatable imagery in order to create a stronger connection with the viewer.</p>

                    <h4>Interactive Solutions</h4>
                    <p>To boost engagement, we incorporated interactive tools like a physician locator, quizzes, and the ability for patients to share their personal stories surrounding colorectal cancer. While the physician finder provides an avenue for patients to connect with local participating physicians, the quizzes help patients determine if they are eligible to get a colonoscopy and assess colon cancer risk.</p>
                    <p>Interactive elements held immense importance for the client’s desired UX. Due to their complexity, we opted to leverage Typeform for the quizzes, which efficiently captures feedback and manages variable conditions. To assist viewers in understanding their specific needs, we combined simple questions with unique illustrated icons that can be seen throughout the site.</p>

                    <h4>Translation Support</h4>
                    <p>In order to further extend the potential patient reach, the client requested we implement a Spanish version of the site. Once our team provided the translations, additional site infrastructure was put in place to support configuring the site’s localization feature, as well as providing auto-detection when possible. Thorough testing was completed following the development of the multi-language feature to ensure the translations seamlessly integrated into the layout and design from device to device.</p>

As a result, the client was satisfied with the easily recognizable brand and messaging throughout this direct to patient website. An intuitive website with accessible content, we believe ColonoscopyToday.com successfully engaged users and hopefully led to an increase in critical screenings.</p>

The layout directed patients to learn more about colorectal screenings, share their experiences, find a physician, and schedule a screening. Large headings and iconography kept the user engaged and provided clear calls to action.</p>
