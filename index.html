                <p>I have worked in the web design and development space for over a decade, and have continually broadened my skillsets over that time. My specialty is designing and developing custom websites and applications, utilizing a wide range of technologies while delivering custom interfaces that focus on user experience, performance, and functionality. I also have extensive experience in designing ads for print and online&nbsp;use.</p>
                <p>This industry is constantly evolving, so I make it a priority to stay at the forefront of the web technology and standards. One of my favorite aspects of web design and development is the opportunity for creative problem-solvingâ€”I love taking on new challenges with each project and seeing the end result come to fruition. I am always eager to learn new skills, and am open to new opportunities and experiences.</p>
