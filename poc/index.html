                    <h1>Health Connective</h1>
                    <p>Health Connective's physician portal proof of concept, is an online interface for pre-surgical planning & post-operative review. Custom built for surgical robots, this platform interprets the massive amount of data collected during procedures, making it accessible to health system clients in various forms.</p>
                    <p>This portal is intended to be used largely by clinical administrators, who aggregate data to evaluate outcomes, searching for cases where the actual surgical pathway deviated from the expected pathway, or for links in cases with adverse events. The dashboard enables administrators to pull data by physician, procedure length, diagnosis, and more, using the information to develop new treatment standards and protocols.</p>

                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                    <p>The client’s existing physician portal did not have the right features in place to keep the user’s attention and these inefficiencies caused them to lose business to competition with better systems in place. The client required a redesigned platform that would get critical data into the hands of those who can use it to improve patient care.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="solution">
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <p>Our team ensured an intuitive UI for the platform that would optimize navigation, accessibility, and user interactions. We improved the portal by adopting a clear design that highlights essential information and provides helpful indicators for physicians to recognize case trends.</p>

        <div class="wrapper section design-process">
            <div class="process">
                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>The client required a user-friendly and strategic interface for their platform. Our team focused first on parsing the data to make it meaningful for each user type, then on optimizing the interface to deliver the most appropriate user experience.</p>
                <p>To achieve this, our team designed various functional UI elements, such as progress-tracking graphics and a sophisticated dashboard with case sharing capabilities. Our team also put a ton of effort into testing and iterating on the design to guarantee the final result met the expectations of our client and their end-users.</p>
                <p>The redesigned physician dashboard incorporates animated and interactive charts to present the massive amount of data that is collected during patient procedures. Key metrics and crucial data is featured on the dashboard while these charts facilitate quick comprehension for both physicians and clinical administrators who may be evaluating procedural outcomes or tracking adverse events. User-friendly data interpretation was ensured through the use of straightforward charts and diagrams.</p>

                    <h4>Outcome</h4>
                    <p>While working on this project, we accomplished multiple tasks and brought many valuable development and design features to life. Paying particular attention to the client’s needs, our team provided engaging design solutions that improve accessibility, set up an adaptive layout for all kinds of devices, and found proper solutions for website optimization.</p>
                    <p>The physician portal proof of concept has since evolved into a complete multi-portal platform that seamlessly aligns with the client's brand and reinforces them as a leader in the surgical robotics market.</p>
